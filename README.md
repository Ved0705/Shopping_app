#  Abstract:

The project is a command-line shopping application implemented in the C programming language. It serves as a basic platform for users to perform various shopping-related tasks, offering functionalities such as searching for items, managing a cart, and calculating the total bill. 

The application begins by prompting users to input their name and address, after which they are presented with a menu-driven interface. Users can search for items by name, add them to their cart, and remove items if needed. Additionally, they can view the available items sorted by price for easier browsing. The cart is maintained using arrays to store item names and their corresponding prices.

One notable feature is the sorting of available items by price, providing users with a sorted list for more convenient selection. This sorting algorithm enhances user experience by presenting items in a logical order based on price.



Overall, this project serves as a foundational example of a shopping application, demonstrating core concepts such as input handling, array manipulation, and menu-driven interfaces in the C programming language.

FEATURES AVAILABLE :
1) Items Available :
This code snippet initializes two arrays, `defaultItems` and `defaultPrices`, representing a list of default items available for purchase and their corresponding prices. The `defaultItems` array stores the names of various items such as "Milk," "Juice," "Eggs," etc., while the `defaultPrices` array holds their respective prices. This code provides a foundation for managing an inventory system or a shopping application by defining the available items and their prices for further processing or display to users.

2) Where user's items are stored :
   This code snippet declares three variables: `cart`, `cartPrices`, and `numItems`.
   1. `cart` is a two-dimensional array to store the names of items added to a shopping cart.
   2. `cartPrices` is an array to store the prices corresponding to the items in the cart.
   3. `numItems` is an integer variable to keep track of the number of items currently in the cart. 
Together, these variables serve as the foundation for managing a shopping cart in a program or application.
