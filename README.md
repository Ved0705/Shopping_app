#  Abstract:

The project is a command-line shopping application implemented in the C programming language. It serves as a basic platform for users to perform various shopping-related tasks, offering functionalities such as searching for items, managing a cart, and calculating the total bill. 

The application begins by prompting users to input their name and address, after which they are presented with a menu-driven interface. Users can search for items by name, add them to their cart, and remove items if needed. Additionally, they can view the available items sorted by price for easier browsing. The cart is maintained using arrays to store item names and their corresponding prices.

One notable feature is the sorting of available items by price, providing users with a sorted list for more convenient selection. This sorting algorithm enhances user experience by presenting items in a logical order based on price.

Furthermore, the application ensures robustness by handling invalid inputs and errors gracefully, thereby improving user interaction and overall usability.

Overall, this project serves as a foundational example of a shopping application, demonstrating core concepts such as input handling, array manipulation, and menu-driven interfaces in the C programming language.
